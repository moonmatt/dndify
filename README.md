# DNDify - an easy way to manage your transactions

This is a free and easy way to manage your money and transactions, it uses just PHP and MySQL, so make sure you have those installed.


First of all, create a database, you can find the SQL inside of "includes > dbh.php", then insert your credentials (host, username, password and dbName).

Then go to the login page "login.php" and edit the credentials on line 8. 


Frontend with Bootstrap4 using theme <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/themes/sb-admin-2/">SbAdmin</a>, backend with PHP.
